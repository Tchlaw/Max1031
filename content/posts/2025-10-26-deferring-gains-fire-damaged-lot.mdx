## Why Receiving Insurance Proceeds Can Still Trigger Tax

Even after total loss, you may owe capital gains if **insurance or sale proceeds exceed your adjusted basis**. Long‑time CA owners are especially exposed.

## §1033 Involuntary Conversion

For property destroyed by casualty/condemnation where you receive compensation:

- **Who qualifies:** Owners with involuntary conversion (fire, theft, condemnation).  
- **Time limit:** Generally **2 years** from the end of the tax year of gain; **4 years** in federally declared disaster areas.  
- **Replacement:** “Similar or related in service or use.” For rentals, this typically means other **investment real estate**.  
- **How to elect:** Report on your return and make a §1033 election.

> 💡 **Example:** Insurance proceeds of $700k on a duplex with $300k basis. Reinvest the full $700k into another rental within the window → **$400k deferred** under §1033.

## §1031 Like‑Kind Exchange (Investment Property)

Selling a burned **investment** lot? You can often use **§1031** to defer gain if you meet **45/180‑day** rules, use a **QI**, and acquire like‑kind investment property.

## §1031 vs §1033 (At a Glance)

| Feature | §1031 Like‑Kind | §1033 Involuntary |
|---|---|---|
| Applies to | Voluntary sale | Disaster/condemnation |
| Deadline | 45/180 days | 2–4 years |
| QI needed? | Yes | No |
| Replacement | Like‑kind investment | Similar/related in use |
| Personal‑use allowed | No | Sometimes (primary residence) |

## §121 Home Sale Exclusion

For a **primary residence**, you may exclude up to **$250k/$500k** of gain if you meet the 2‑of‑5‑year tests. Excess gain may still be deferrable under **§1033**.

## Coordinating the Rules

Mixed‑use? Apply **§121** to the home portion, and **§1031/§1033** to the rental portion. Keep meticulous records of **insurance**, **repairs**, and **sale** docs.
