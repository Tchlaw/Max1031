> **Quick Take:** A reverse exchange “parks” title with an **EAT** so you can buy now and sell within **180 days**—crucial in competitive markets.

## Reverse Exchange Basics

Under **IRS Rev. Proc. 2000‑37**, an **Exchange Accommodation Titleholder (EAT)** temporarily holds title to either the replacement or relinquished property. This avoids owning both at the same time while you meet §1031’s rules.

### Key Players

- **You (Exchanger)** — must meet 45/180‑day deadlines  
- **Qualified Intermediary (QI)** — structures and escrows  
- **EAT (parking LLC)** — holds title up to 180 days  
- **Bridge/Private Lender** — finances the parked property

## Timeline (Safe Harbor)

```text
Day 0    EAT acquires (parks) replacement
Day 45   You identify the relinquished property
Day 180  You close the sale of the relinquished property
```

## Financing a Parked Asset

Banks may balk while an EAT is on title. Common solutions: **bridge loans**, **seller carryback**, or **cash now + refinance** after transfer.

## California‑Specific Notes

- **Documentary Transfer Tax:** Some counties may assess DTT **twice** (seller→EAT and EAT→you). Budget or negotiate.  
- **FTB 3840:** If you later move the asset out of CA, file annually to track deferred CA‑source gain.  
- **Community Property:** Ensure both spouses sign exchange assignments to avoid vesting issues.

## Cost Snapshot (Example $3M Buy / $3M Sell)

| Fee | Typical Range |
|---|---|
| EAT/parking setup | $3,500–$6,000 |
| QI reverse fee | $3,000–$5,000 |
| Extra escrow/title | $2,000–$4,000 |
| Bridge interest (≈11%, 3 mo) | ≈ $82,500 per $3M |
| Potential second DTT | Varies by county |

## Case Study: Duplex → NNN Retail

1. **Day 0:** EAT acquires CVS with bridge + cash.  
2. **Day 33:** Duplex listed.  
3. **Day 45:** Identify relinquished property.  
4. **Day 120:** Duplex sale closes; bridge paid off.  
5. **Day 121:** EAT transfers to you. **Gain deferred.**

## Common Pitfalls & Fixes

| Pitfall | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Missing 180 days | Pre‑list, build schedule buffer |
| Debt mismatch | Refinance **after** exchange closes |
| Contract assignment gaps | Add “and/or assigns”; formal EAT assignment |
| Lender rejects EAT | Vet bridge/private lenders early |
