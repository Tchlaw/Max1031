> **Quick Take:** If a **real** exchange starts in December and your **QI** holds proceeds past year‑end, gain is typically recognized **next** year.

## How It Works

Start a legitimate §1031 with a **Qualified Intermediary**, follow the **45‑day** ID rule, and keep proceeds **out of your control** through **December 31**. If the exchange fails, recognition generally occurs when the QI releases funds—often the **next** year.

### Example Timeline

| Event | Date | Tax Year Recognized |
|---|---|---|
| Sale & exchange opened | Dec 20, 2025 | — |
| ID period ends (fails) | Feb 3, 2026 | — |
| QI releases proceeds | June 2026 | **2026** |

## Why It Matters

- Defers large gains into the next tax year  
- Improves cash‑flow and estimated tax planning  
- Keeps option open to complete a late find

## What Counts as “Bona Fide”

- **Written exchange agreement** with a QI prior to closing  
- **Proceeds held** by QI through year‑end  
- **Good‑faith intent** to exchange (document search efforts)

> ⚠️ **Cautions:** This doesn’t eliminate tax; if your QI releases funds before Dec 31, gain is current‑year. Confirm state conformity (CA generally follows).
