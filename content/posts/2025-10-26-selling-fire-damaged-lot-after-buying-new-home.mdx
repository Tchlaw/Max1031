> **Quick Take:** Buying first doesn’t automatically spoil deferral. **Intent + timing** can support §1033, and §121 may still exclude big chunks of gain.

## The Core Issue: Sequence & Intent

If your new home clearly **replaces** the residence destroyed by fire—and you’re within §1033’s timeline—deferral can still apply, even if you purchased first.

## Option 1 — §1033 (Primary Residence)

- **Timing:** Generally **2 years** from end of tax year of gain (often **4 years** in disaster areas).  
- **Order:** You may buy the new home **before** selling the old lot.  
- **Proof:** Keep records (insurance, bids, communications) showing replacement intent.

## Option 2 — §121 Home Sale Exclusion

If you owned/used the destroyed home for **2 of 5 years**, exclude up to **$250k/$500k**. The exclusion often applies even if you already bought the new home.

> 💡 **Combo Play:** Apply **§121** first to exclude, then use **§1033** to defer any remaining gain by reinvesting in the replacement.

## Documentation Checklist

- Escrow statements, insurance settlements, closing docs  
- Notation of disaster declaration dates (for 4‑year window)  
- CPA memo electing §1033 treatment
