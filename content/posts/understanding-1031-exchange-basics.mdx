# Understanding 1031 Exchange Basics

> **Quick Take:**  
> A 1031 exchange lets you sell an investment property and reinvest into another—*without paying capital gains tax today*. This guide breaks down what qualifies, how the timeline works, and how investors use it to grow wealth strategically.

## ✅ What You’ll Learn

- What a 1031 exchange is and why investors use it
- The 45-day and 180-day deadlines (and how not to miss them)
- Rules for identifying replacement property
- How to avoid “boot” and achieve full tax deferral

## 🧠 What Is a 1031 Exchange?

A **1031 exchange** — named after Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code — allows you to sell one **investment or business property** and buy another *like-kind property* **while deferring capital gains tax** that would normally be due at sale.

This gives investors the ability to:

- Preserve equity rather than lose it to taxes
- Reposition into stronger or more strategic assets
- Compound long-term wealth without immediate tax erosion

---

## 🧩 Key Requirements

To qualify for a 1031 exchange, you must meet **all** of the following:

- Property must be held for **investment or business use**
- You must **identify replacement property within 45 days**
- You must **close on the replacement within 180 days**  
  (or by your tax filing due date, if earlier)
- A **Qualified Intermediary (QI)** must hold the funds — you can’t receive or control the proceeds
- The same taxpayer/entity that sells must be the one that buys

## 🔁 How a 1031 Exchange Works (Step-by-Step)

1. **Plan early** — speak with your CPA, legal advisor, and QI  
2. **Sell your property** — sale proceeds go directly to the QI  
3. **Identify replacements** — submit your **45-day written list** to your QI  
4. **Perform due diligence** — inspect, negotiate, line up financing  
5. **Close on the replacement** — must be completed within **180 days**  
6. **Report the exchange** — file IRS **Form 8824** with your tax return  

> 💡 **Timeline Tip:**  
> Day 1 starts the *day after* your sale closes. The 45- and 180-day deadlines are strict — extensions almost never apply.

## 🏷️ The 45-Day Identification Rules

There are three IRS-approved methods to identify replacement properties:

- **3-Property Rule:** Identify up to **3 properties of any value**
- **200% Rule:** Identify any number of properties, **total value ≤ 200%** of what you sold
- **95% Rule:** Identify any number of properties, but you must **close on at least 95%** of the total value identified

---

## 💸 Avoiding Boot: Replacing Equity & Debt

To **fully defer taxes**, you must:

- Buy property of **equal or greater value**
- Reinvest **all net equity** (sale proceeds)
- Replace **equal or greater debt**  
  (cash can be added to offset a debt shortfall)

If you take cash out or reduce debt without replacing it, the difference is considered **boot**, which is typically taxable.

## 🔄 Types of 1031 Exchanges

| Exchange Type | When It’s Used |
|----------------|----------------|
| **Forward Exchange** | Sell first, buy second — the most common |
| **Reverse Exchange** | Buy first, sell later using an Exchange Accommodation Titleholder (EAT) |
| **Improvement / Build-to-Suit** | Use exchange funds to improve the new property before taking title |
| **Consolidation / Diversification** | Trade one for many, or many for one, to reshape your portfolio |
