## What is a 1031 Exchange?

A **1031 exchange** — named after Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code — allows you to sell one **investment or business property** and buy another *like-kind property* **while deferring capital gains taxes** that would normally be due at sale.

This helps investors:

- Preserve equity
- Reposition into stronger or more strategic properties
- Compound long-term wealth without immediate tax erosion

---

## Key Requirements

To qualify for a 1031 exchange:

- The property must be held for **investment or business purposes**
- You must **identify replacement property within 45 days**
- You must **complete the exchange within 180 days** (or by your tax filing due date, if earlier)
- You must use a **Qualified Intermediary (QI)** — you cannot receive or control sale proceeds

## How the 1031 Exchange Process Works

1. **Plan early:** Engage your QI and CPA before opening escrow.  
2. **Sell your property:** Proceeds go directly to the QI.  
3. **Identify replacement properties:** Submit written identification to your QI within 45 days.  
4. **Perform due diligence:** Inspect, negotiate, and secure financing.  
5. **Acquire replacement property:** QI wires funds to close within 180 days.  
6. **Report the exchange:** File IRS Form 8824 with your tax return.  

> **Timeline Tip:**  
> Day 1 starts the day *after* closing. The 45-day and 180-day deadlines are strict and almost never extendable.

## The 45-Day Identification Rules

You must identify replacement property using one of the IRS-approved methods:

- **3-Property Rule:** Identify up to 3 properties of any value  
- **200% Rule:** Identify any number of properties, as long as total value ≤ 200% of the relinquished property  
- **95% Rule:** Identify any number of properties, but you must close on at least 95% of the total value identified

## Avoiding Boot: Replacing Equity and Debt

To fully defer taxes, you must:

- Buy property of **equal or greater value**
- Reinvest **all net equity** (sale proceeds)
- Replace **equal or greater debt** — or contribute cash to offset any reduction in debt

Any funds or debt not reinvested is considered **boot**, which is generally taxable.
