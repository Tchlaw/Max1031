Many real estate investors know about **1031 exchanges**.  
Very few understand **Section 721** — the tax code provision that lets investors move into a **REIT** structure *without paying capital gains taxes*.

Used correctly, a 721 can be one of the most powerful estate-planning and passive-income tools available.

Used blindly, it can trap your capital, eliminate your ability to 1031 again, and expose you to leverage and liquidity risks you never signed up for.

This is a clear, practical, investor-first guide to how you can move into a REIT structure.

## **What a Section 721 Exchange Really Is**

A **Section 721 exchange** lets you contribute real estate to a **partnership**—typically the Operating Partnership (“OP”) that sits underneath a REIT—**without triggering taxes on your gain**.

> **“No gain or loss is recognized when property is contributed to a partnership in exchange for an interest in that partnership.”**  
—IRC §721(a)

In simple terms:

- The REIT (or its operating partnership) wants your property  
- You contribute the property  
- You receive partnership/OP units instead of cash  
- **No capital gains tax is triggered**

But here’s the important nuance:

Most REITs **do not** acquire properties directly from individual owners.

## **How 721 Exchanges Work in the Real World**

The most common path looks like this:

### **Step 1 — You Sell Your Property and 1031 Into a DST**
You complete a standard 1031 exchange.  
Your sale proceeds go into a **Delaware Statutory Trust (DST)** that the REIT has pre-selected.

- All taxes are deferred under **1031**
- You receive fractional DST ownership
- You begin receiving passive income

### **Step 2 — The REIT Rolls the DST Into Its Operating Partnership**
After a holding period (typically 2–4 years):

- The REIT absorbs (or “UPREITs”) the DST  
- Your DST interest is contributed to the OP  
- You receive OP units  
- Taxes remain deferred under **721**

This creates a seamless, **two-step tax-deferred transition**:

**1031 → DST → REIT (via 721)**

It’s elegant.  
It’s powerful.  
And — if handled improperly — it can create risks many investors never see coming.

## **Why Some Investors Love 721 Exchanges**

### ✔ **Retire from landlord responsibilities**
You never fix toilets, manage tenants, or deal with local regulations again.

### ✔ **Diversification across many properties**
Instead of owning one building, your OP units are backed by a *portfolio* of industrial, multifamily, retail, medical, and logistics properties.

### ✔ **Access to structured liquidity**
Non-traded REITs often offer redemption windows (subject to limits).

### ✔ **Estate-planning benefits**
If OP units are held until death, your heirs receive a **step-up in basis** — wiping out all past deferred gain.

### ✔ **Exit California real estate without paying taxes**
You can leave high-cost, low-yield markets without an immediate tax hit.

For many older investors (especially 65+), the 721 strategy is a clean, low-stress retirement exit.

---

## **The Hidden Risks No One Talks About**

### ❌ **1. The REIT Is the End of the 1031 Road**

Once your DST units convert into OP units:

- You **cannot** 1031 again  
- Any future liquidation = **taxable event**

If long-term tax deferral matters, this is a major loss of optionality.

---

### ❌ **2. You Absorb the REIT’s Leverage—Whether You Want It or Not**

Many investors 1031 into **debt-free DSTs**.

But the REIT they ultimately join may carry **50–70% leverage**.

You inherit:

- Adjustable-rate debt risk  
- Refinancing risk  
- Foreclosure risk  
- Interest-rate shock risk  

This is the #1 surprise for conservative, low-LTV investors.

---

### ❌ **3. Debt Maturities Can Crush Distributions**

Across the industry, many REITs have **30–50% of their debt maturing within 24 months**.

Rising rates mean:

- Higher interest expense  
- Lower AFFO  
- Reduced or eliminated distributions  

This is happening in real time.

---

### ❌ **4. Redemptions Can Freeze Overnight**

Structured liquidity ≠ guaranteed liquidity.

Non-traded REITs frequently:

- Limit redemptions  
- Freeze redemptions  
- Adjust NAV downward during stressed periods  

Investors need to be prepared for long holding periods.

---

### ❌ **5. Hidden Markups When REITs Sell Properties Into DSTs**

Some REITs “drop down” properties they already own into DST wrappers at inflated prices to raise capital.

Example:

- Fair market value: **$100M**  
- Dropped into DST at: **$120M**  
- Investors immediately start **20% underwater**  

This is one of the least-discussed risks in the industry.

---

### ❌ **6. Weak or Short-Term Tax Protection Agreements (TPAs)**

If the REIT sells a property you rolled into:

- **Inside TPA window** → you’re protected  
- **Outside TPA window** (often only 2–5 years) → you may owe taxes you did not expect

This is a real and material risk.

---

### ❌ **7. Forced UPREITs Eliminate Your Control**

Some DSTs are structured as **forced UPREITs**:

- No investor choice  
- No optionality  
- No ability to reassess market conditions  
- Timing dictated by the sponsor  

For sophisticated investors, this can be a poor fit.

---

## **When a 721 Is a Great Fit**

### **Ideal profiles:**

- Investors **65+** who want a *final* exit from management  
- Landlords ready to retire from active ownership  
- Investors who will *never* 1031 again  
- People who want diversified, passive exposure  
- Investors looking for estate-planning optimization  
- Those who may need liquidity in 3–7 years  

If someone says:

> “I never want to own or manage another property again.”

…a 721 can be the perfect solution.

---

## **When a 721 Is a Bad Fit**

### **Poor fit for:**

- Investors under 60 building long-term wealth  
- Anyone who wants future 1031 optionality  
- Investors uncomfortable with leverage or refinancing risk  
- People needing predictable distributions  
- Clients who want control over timing and tax posture  

This is why 721s should never be treated as the “default” recommendation.

## **Bottom Line**

**Section 721 UPREIT exchanges are powerful — but only when used thoughtfully.**

They provide:

- Passive income  
- Diversification  
- Potential liquidity  
- Estate-planning advantages  
- Full tax deferral  

But they also carry:

- Leverage risk  
- Liquidity risk  
- Loss of 1031 optionality  
- Hidden markups  
- TPA exposure  
- Redemption uncertainty  

The right question isn’t:  
**“Is a 721 good or bad?”**  
It’s:  
**“Is a 721 right for *this investor* at *this stage* of their life?”**

Used correctly, it’s an excellent tool.  
Used casually, it can create preventable problems.
